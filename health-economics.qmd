## Key concepts supported by our experts team

### 1. Optimizing Opportunity Cost

The value of the best alternative use of resources.

### 2. Increased Efficiency

-   **Technical efficiency**: producing care at lowest cost

-   **Allocative efficiency**: allocating resources to maximize population health

### 3. Equity

How healthcare is distributed across individuals or groups.

Efficiency and equity often conflict.

### 4. Utility and QALYs

Models relying on **quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)** combining survival and quality of life.

### 5. Cost-Effectiveness

Comparing incremental cost per incremental health gain (e.g., ICERs).
