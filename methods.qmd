## Model Structure

Our experts can support you running the optimal models based on your situation:

| Situation                         | Best Fit           |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------|
| Acute, short-term                 | Decision tree      |
| Chronic disease, simple structure | Markov cohort      |
| Survival-driven oncology          | Semi-Markov or PSM |
| Strong time-in-state effects      | Semi-Markov        |
| High heterogeneity                | Microsimulation    |
| Operational/system constraints    | DES                |
