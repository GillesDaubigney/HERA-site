Increased Efficiency\n\nTechnical efficiency: producing care at lowest cost\nAllocative efficiency: allocating resources to maximize population health\n\n\n\n3. Equity\nHow healthcare is distributed across individuals or groups.\nEfficiency and equity often conflict.\n\n\n4. Utility and QALYs\nModels relying on quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) combining survival and quality of life.\n\n\n5. Cost-Effectiveness\nComparing incremental cost per incremental health gain (e.g., ICERs)."
